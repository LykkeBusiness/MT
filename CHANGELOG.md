## 2.32.0 - Nova 2. Delivery 41 (April 01, 2024)
### What's changed
* LT-5298: Looping error in mtcore requesting to stop the trading.
* LT-5279: Adjust the snapshot flow.
* LT-5061: Order does not execute automatically when contribution is started again.

### Deployment

* Add a new settings section: `BookKeeperServiceClient` (on the same level as `SettingsServiceClient`, `AccountsManagementServiceClient` etc)
Then fill the `ServiceUrl` parameter with Bookkeeper's api url

example:

```json
{
   "BookKeeperServiceClient": {
      "ServiceUrl": "//url"
   }
}
```

* (Optional) Add a new settings section: `SnapshotMonitorSettings`. Then fill the parameters 
`MonitoringDelay` and `DelayBeforeFallbackSnapshot`.
`MonitoringDelay` determines how often the service will check if snapshot was created.
`DelayBeforeFallbackSnapshot` determines maximum timeout before a fallback creation of snapshot will occur.

Default values: 
- `MonitoringDelay`: 30 sec
- `DelayBeforeFallbackSnapshot`: 5 min

Both parameters must be configured as timespans (e.g. `"00:03:00"`)

example: 
```json
{
   "SnapshotMonitorSettings": {
      "MonitoringDelay": "//timespan",
      "DelayBeforeFallbackSnapshot": "//timespan"
   }
}
```

* Add `ConnectionString` to `SettingsChangedRabbitMqSettings`.

The result should look like this:
```json
{
    "RabbitMqPublishers": {
      "OrderHistory": {
        "ExchangeName": "lykke.mt.orderhistory",
...
      },
// ... other publishers
}, // publishers sections closes here

    "FxRateRabbitMqSettings": {
      "ConnectionString": "${MtRabbitMqConnectionString}",
      "ExchangeName": "lykke.stpexchangeconnector.fxRates"
    },
// .., other rabbit mq settings
    "SettingsChangedRabbitMqSettings": {
      "ConnectionString": "${MtRabbitMqConnectionString}",
      "ExchangeName": "MtCoreSettingsChanged"
    },
}
```

* Move `RfqChangedRabbitMqSettings` configuration section to `RabbitMqPublishers` section

#### RabbitMQ Connection Retry Policies
The new feature `RabbitMQ Connection Retry Policies` was introduced in this release.
We've added two new retry policies to improve the connection stability with the RabbitMQ broker. These policies define the number of retries and the time intervals between each retry attempt. 
* `InitialConnectionSleepIntervals`: This policy is used during the service startup when establishing the initial connections to the RabbitMQ broker. The number of items in the array represents the number of retry attempts, while the interval between items indicates the amount of time to wait before the next retry. 
* `RegularSleepIntervals`: This policy is used during the service's normal operation if the connection to the RabbitMQ broker is detected to be broken. Similar to the InitialConnectionSleepIntervals policy, the number of items in the array defines the number of retries, and the interval between items indicates the amount of time to wait before the next retry.

If all retry attempts are exhausted and the connection to the RabbitMQ broker is still unsuccessful, an exception will be raised.
To configure the RabbitMQ connection retry policies, you need to update the appsettings.json file by adding the `RabbitMqRetryPolicy` section as follows (the one should add new sub-section into `MtBackend`):
```json
{
   "MtBackend":{
      "RabbitMqRetryPolicy":{
         "InitialConnectionSleepIntervals":[
            "00:00:01",
            "00:00:02",
            "00:00:04",
            "00:00:08",
            "00:00:16",
            "00:00:32",
            "00:01:04",
            "00:02:08"
         ],
         "RegularSleepIntervals":[
            "00:00:01",
            "00:00:02",
            "00:00:02",
            "00:00:02",
            "00:00:02",
            "00:00:03",
            "00:00:03",
            "00:00:05"
         ]
      }
   }
}
```

The one can customize the number of retries and the sleep intervals by modifying the arrays for `InitialConnectionSleepIntervals` and `RegularSleepIntervals`, respectively. Make sure to follow the time format `HH:mm:ss` when specifying the intervals.
